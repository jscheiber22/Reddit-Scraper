# Reddit-Scraper
Scrape your favorite subreddits and download the content for use in machine learning or mass backup applications. An example of such an application might be if you needed to train a machine vision system to detect guitars, you could bulk download from [r/guitars](https://www.reddit.com/r/guitars/) and have more guitar pictures than you could ever want. Then, you could pull a bunch of images from [r/drums](https://www.reddit.com/r/drums/) and you'd have a bunch of relevant negative images to use in your model.

# Disclaimer
This app was created ages before I am now writing this, so we're in the same boat for figuring out how it works.

# Detailed Tutorial
Looks like you have to go in and change your "dest" destination and then create a "toSearch" file with no extensions. Good luck on Windows I guess. Then put each subreddit name on its own line in that file and save it. Also use "#" for comments. Then just run the program and it'll do its thing.
